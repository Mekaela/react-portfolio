I reguarly complete courses and projects in software development because I enjoy it, so I would love to continue doing that as a career, but I also like money, and my work is worth more as an analyst. That's not to say I don't enjoy analyst work. I'm analytical be nature and absolutely love the communication that comes with being an Analyst. Being a translater between Developers and Business is an interesting place to be. \nThats why I am applying for, and happy to be in, both roles."},{id:2,question:"Why is my background so varied?",answer:"I've spent a long time finding the right career. I started in environmental science, which I loved, but didn't love me back and I ended up unemployed after uni. I had a few odd jobs and an accounting degree between that and becoming an IT Business Analyst with Services Australia. \n My partner had some visa issues and so we left Australia and I therefore left the BA job. Overseas I then had visa issues and only ended up working a quick three month job as an IT Analyst. \n\n When I came back to Australia I took on a non-IT BA role. It gave me some good BA skills, like process mapping, but it made it harder to jump back into IT and as it involved large (upto 5 hour) sessions of training customers how to use a software, I burnt out. I saw an opportunity to retrain as a developer, and as I was already coding as a hobby, I jumped on it. For 18 months I worked for Lendi as a developer and loved it. I was on a contract though and so my work with them finished at the 18 month mark. I had good reviews, but my timing was bad and they also laid off several permanenet members of my team."},{id:3,question:"What is my salary expectation?",answer:"My salary depends on location, how much I can work remotely and if it's a BA, or a dev role. \n\n As a developer I'm looking for permanent roles and I can start at $85,000 (+super) for a fully remote role (i.e. work from anywhere in Australia), up to $100,000 (+super) for an office based role in Sydney. Sydney's expensive and being in the office is expensive. Other cities - somewhere in between. \n\n As a BA I'm looking at contract roles anywhere from 3 months to 18 months in any location. My rate is dependent on the contract - between $600/day (fully remote) to $800/day. "},{id:4,question:"Where am I based?",answer:"I'm between Perth and Sydney at the moment, but have lived in a few places around Australia and am happy anywhere as long as the company culture is good.
